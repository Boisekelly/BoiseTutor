        You have reached the website for KT Tutoring, your one-stop resource for improving your understanding of 
        your college subjects. If you are struggling with your classes or you simply want to get ahead, you have 
        come to the right place. The cost of tutoring is $40 per hour and is currently only offered in person at 
        a Boise location. You can submit your tutoring request by clicking the "Contact" link at the bottom of the page.
        The following list of subjects is not comprehensive, but includes a sampling of some 
        of the topics we offer.
